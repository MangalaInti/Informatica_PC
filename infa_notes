Informatica PowerCenter architecture is based on client-server architecture. 

PowerCenter server is the basic administrative unit of Informatica, where we configure all the services, create users and assign authentication.

Informatica has a service-oriented architecture that provides the ability to scale services and share resources across multiple machines. 
Node is a logical representation of the Informatica installation on a server.  

Domain is a collection of nodes and services.

The services like *Integration service and **Repository service are created on domain and assigned to selective node in the domain based on the availability of the resource on that domain.
The ODBC driver is used to connect the different sources to PowerCenter client
The final output will be loaded into target with the help of ODBC/Native drivers

*Integration Service is an application service that runs sessions and workflows. Without Integration service you cannot load the data to data warehouse.

**Repository Service manages the repository. It performs all metadata transactions between the repository database and repository clients.

--Parameters in Informatica are constant values (datatypes strings, numbers, etcâ€¦).
--Variables change values within a single session run.
